Name
Yersinia - A FrameWork for layer 2 attacks
Synopsis
yersinia [-hVGIDd] [-l logfile] [-c conffile] protocol [-M] [protocol_options]
Description
yersinia is a framework for performing layer 2 attacks. The following protocols have been implemented in Yersinia current version: Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP), Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP), Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP), IEEE 802.1Q, Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and, finally, the Inter-Switch Link Protocol (ISL).
Some of the attacks implemented will cause a DoS in a network, other will help to perform any other more advanced attack, or both. In addition, some of them will be first released to the public since there isn't any public implementation.

Yersinia will definitely help both pen-testers and network administrators in their daily tasks.

Some of the mentioned attacks are DoS attacks, so TAKE CARE about what you're doing because you can convert your network into an UNSTABLE one.

A lot of examples are given at this page EXAMPLES section, showing a real and useful program execution.

Options
-h, --help
Help screen.
-V, --Version
Program version.
-G
Start a graphical GTK session.
-I, --interactive
Start an interactive ncurses session.
-D, --daemon
Start the network listener for remote admin (Cisco CLI emulation).
-d

-l logfile
Save the current session to the file logfile. If logfile exists, the data will be appended at the end.
-c conffile

Gtk GUI
The GTK GUI (-G) is a GTK graphical interface with all of the yersinia powerful features and a professional 'look and feel'.
Ncurses GUI
The ncurses GUI (-I) is a ncurses (or curses) based console where the user can take advantage of yersinia powerful features.
Press 'h' to display the Help Screen and enjoy your session :)

Network Daemon
The Network Daemon (-D) is a telnet based server (ala Cisco mode) that listens by default in port 12000/tcp waiting for incoming telnet connections.
It supports a CLI similar to a Cisco device where the user (once authenticated) can display different settings and can launch attacks without having yersinia running in her own machine (specially useful for Windows users).

Examples
- Send a Rapid Spanning-Tree BPDU with port role designated, port state agreement, learning and port id 0x3000 to eth1:
yersinia stp -attack 0 -version 2 -flags 5c -portid

3000 -interface eth1

- Start a Spanning-Tree nonDoS root claiming attack in the first nonloopback interface (keep in mind that this kind of attack will use the first BPDU on the network interface to fill in the BPDU fields properly):

yersinia stp -attack 4

- Start a Spanning-Tree DoS attack sending TCN BPDUs in the eth0 interface with MAC address 66:66:66:66:66:66:

yersinia

stp -attack 3 -source 66:66:66:66:66:66
